This works differently than parry, which is explained below. This modifies whether you take a critical hit. So if you don't have really high strength you probably will want parry too.\r\n\r\nDexterity:\r\nFor every point of base dexterity your character receives 1% chance of dodging a critical hit. This ability stacks with the strength critical hit dodge.
