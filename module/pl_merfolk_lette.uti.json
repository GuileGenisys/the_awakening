From the Court of Queen Giauhara, ruler of the Great Blue.\n\nAs well you know relations between ourselves and the land-dwellers have long been strained.  In the last fortnight the Queen herself whilst out for a stroll in her pleasure gardens had witness to a group of what are called \"swimmers\" by their kind.  One of them emitted a foul and yellow liquid which we can only conclude was attempt directly on the life of your Queen and mine.  She, incensed by this affront, has demanded you go and speak post-haste with King Saleh.  Bid him to ready his officers and army for a full assault on these vile and oafish land-dwellers.  She wishes that an example be made of their nearest city to your kingdom.  Failure will result in dire consequences."
