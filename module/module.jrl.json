They are NOT normal levels, and they only affect some of your character's attributes. They do not, for instance, affect caster level, spell penetration, or attack bonus. The ONLY affects that they have are listed below. The class in which you can levels is your \"control class\", which is basically whatever class you have the most levels in at 40th. Once you take Legendary Levels you will no longer be able to relevel, nor is it likely that DMs will be able to help you fix any mistakes.\n---------\nSkills:\nCharacters gain their normal allotment of skill points for every legendary level, including a +1 bonus for humans and any intelligence bonuses. They spend them in the usual manner, with class skills costing one point and cross-class skills costing 2 points. Points may be saved from level to level, if desired.\n\nFeats:\nCharacters continue to gain a general feat every three levels, beginning at level 42, 3 levels after the last received at level 39. Some classes gain access to feats they might not otherwise have in Legendary Levels, check class customizations for specifics.\n\nAbility Points:\nCharacters gain ability points at an accelerated rate during legendary levels, receiving an additional ability point every 2 levels, beginning at level 42.\n\nSaving Throws:\nCharacter saving throws increase during legendary levels, but at a slower pace than before. A character gains +1 to all saving throws every 4 levels, beginning at level 44.\n\nHit Points:\nCharacters automatically gain the maximum hitpoints for their class, including a bonus for the toughness feat and any constitution bonuses.\n\nCurrent XP Requirements:\n40 = 780000\n41 = 1000000\n42 = 1200000\n43 = 1400000\n44 = 1600000\n45 = 1800000\n46 = 2000000\n47 = 2200000\n48 = 2400000\n49 = 2600000\n50 = 2800000\n51 = 3000000\n52 = 3200000\n53 = 3400000\n54 = 3600000\n55 = 3800000\n56 = 4000000\n57 = 4200000\n58 = 4400000\n59 = 4600000\n60 = 4800000\n\n(Taken from NWVault posting, original author: FunkySwerve)"
