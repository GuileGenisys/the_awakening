* **Level 35:** Fighter receives Epic Dodge free, regardless of whether he/she qualifies.
* **Level 45:** Fighters are able to choose an optional Fighting Style.  The receive requirements and benefits listed below, and also special combat animations (with the custom hak).  This choice is one-time only and permanent.  The animations may be turned on or off.  These are not available to Paragons.
    * **Fencer** (Single Wielder): A fighter using this style is able to use their Discpline AC bonus regardless of their Strength ability level.  However, to receive the bonus, they may not wear a shield, or wield an two-handed weapon.
    * **Kensei** (Single Wielder): A fighter with this style is able to use Monk attack progressions with any finessable bladed weapon (i.e no Pick, Handaxe, or Light Hammer, etc).  However, to receive the bonus, they may not wear a shield, or wield a two-handed weapon.
    * **Spartan** (Sword & Shield): Fighters taking this style are able to use their shields as a weapon, thereby gaining an extra attack.  The damage will be as the weapon they wield.
    * **Warlord** (Two-Handed): A fighter selecting this style increases their two-handed damage bonus to 2x their Strength modifier.  NOTE: This style does not work with Quarterstaff if the fighter has a monk level.
