**Class Customizations**

* Pale Masters add half their PM levels to their caster level for all spells schools except Necromancy, which adds all levels.
* If your character has greater than 25 base ability scores in Dexterity or Strength, PM AC bonus is halved.  The Tumble skill cap is calculated after this, so you can invest in more tumble if you take this route.
* **Level 15:** Hit Point Bonus from Deathless Vigor increases to +10 per 5 PM levels.
* **Level 20:** Epic Energy Resist Cold
* **Level 25:** Hit Point Bonus from Deathless Vigor increases to +20 per 5 PM levels.
* **Level 30:** Permanent immunity to sneak attacks.
* **Level 35:** Auto Still Spell
* **Level 40:** Undead Transformation: Spell DCs on Necromantic spells receive a +10 bonus.  PMs may also choose an alternate appearance, this is change is totally optional.  The available appearances are Lich, Skeleton, Spectre, and Zombie.
* **Level 45:** Auto Still Spell
