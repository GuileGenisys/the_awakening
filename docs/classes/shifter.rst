**Future Directions:** With many new additions itâ€™s not clear exactly how the individual shapes would need to be changed, so they have not changed.

**Class Customizations**
* All gear merges and properly stacks in every shape. Occasionally in the unarmed shapes the character sheet won't properly reflect your gear and so you'll need to check the combat log to ensure that your gear is properly merged.
* On The Awakening characters are saved when they rest and when they acquire or unacquire an item, so you will be 'deshifted' momentarily before your polymorph is re-applied in the latter cases.
* While shifted Shifter's use there Wisdom modifier for AB, if it is higher than their Dexterity or Strength modifier.
* Any weapon feat that you posses will be 'morphed' with you into the feat for the weapon which the shape uses.
* Shifters gain +1 ab per 5 shifter levels in polymorphed shapes. This counts towards the +20ab cap.
* See the Polymorph for specifics on what bonuses are applied when shifted.
