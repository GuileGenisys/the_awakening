**Future Directions:**

* With many new additions itâ€™s not clear exactly how the individual shapes would need to be changed, so they have not changed.
* Spells will continue to be revised until there seems to be a reasonable balance.

**Class Customizations**

* Legendary DC Bonus: Every four levels over 40 Druids receive a +1 to their spell DCs to a maximum of +5.
* Epic Spell Progressions: Druids now receive a bonus spell slot to all spell levels every 4 epic levels. Please see the PDF files attached to this post for the new Druid spell progressions.
* All gear merges and properly stacks in every shape. Occasionally in the unarmed shapes the character sheet won't properly reflect your gear and so you'll need to check the combat log to ensure that your gear is properly merged.
* On The Awakening characters are saved when they rest and when they acquire or unacquire an item, so you will be 'deshifted' momentarily before your polymorph is re-applied in the latter cases.
* See the Polymorph for specifics on what bonuses are applied when shifted.
* **Level 40:** Epic Energy Resist Cold
* **Level 42:** Epic Energy Resist Fire
* **Level 44:** Epic Energy Resist Electricity
* **Level 46:** Epic Energy Resist Acid
* **Level 48:** Epic Energy Resist Sonic
