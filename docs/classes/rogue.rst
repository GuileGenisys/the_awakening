**Class Customizations:**
* **Level 45:** At level 45 Rogues are able to use stealth twice per day which casts a Sanctuary effect on themselves.  DC: 10 + Hide Skill / 2 (Max 70).  Duration: Hide Skill / 3 in Seconds (Max: 40 Seconds).  If the Rogues does not have Hide in Plain Sight, they will be unable to use this ability when in the visibility of enemies.

**Feat Customizations**

* **Crippling Strike:** At 30 levels of Rogue crit range is increased by 1. At 35 levels of rogue also gains +1 to their critical hit multiplier.  To use this the rogue must be using a simple weapon. **Multiplier does not stack with Devastating Critical.**  **Range does not stack with Overwhelming Critical or WM**
* **Opportunist:** At 25 levels of Rogue, they add their intelligence modifier to their attack roll. For every five levels above 20 (with a cap at 40) Rogues are able to use +1 from their Int modifier At 30 levels, they gain an additional point. Thus the max for a pure rogue would be +5. This does not count against the +20 ab cap.
    * 25th Level: +1
    * 30th Level: +3
    * 35th Level: +4
    * 40th Level: +5

* **Self Concealment:** At 30 levels of rogue, characters may add a percentage of their Hide skill to their self concealment. The bonus is 5% for SC1 and proceeds to 9%, 12%, 14%, and 15%. The bonus is capped at 1% of Hide skill per level of rogue above 20 (so, the cap begins at 10% at 30 levels of rogue and reaches its maximum of 15% at 35 levels of rogue).
