Feat Customizations
-------------------

* Death Arrow: AA does a ranged touch attack. Targets that are hit will take half their current hitpoints in piercing damage, with a fortitude save for half.  If the touch attack is a critical hit, the effect becomes exactly like Harm, except the damage is piercing.  DC is calculated as 10 + Wisdom or Dexterity Modifier (whichever is higher) + 1 per 5 Arcane Archer levels.
* Hail of Arrows: Hail does 1d8 of piercing damage per AA level to a maximum of 50d8 and also 1d8 of magical damage per Enchant Arrow feat.  Hail requires enemies to be in line of sight.  I.e. no shooting through walls.
* Imbue Arrow: Damage to the targeted creature remains the same.  The area explosion damage has been increased to 1d10 of fire per AA level +1 per AA levels to a maximum of 50d10 + 50.
Seeker Arrow: Seeker Arrow does 1d12 of piercing damage per AA level to a maximum of 50d12 plus 1d12 of magical damage per Enchant Arrow feat.
