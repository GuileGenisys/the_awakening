Weapon Master
=============

nwnwiki: http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Weapon_master

**Feat Customizations**

* **Weapon of Choice (unarmed):** This feat is available with the custom hak and thus unarmed WM monks are possible.

* **Ki Damage:** This feat has been changed such that it is now a passive feat.  It grants +1 damage bonus per 3 wm levels to a maximum of +16.  Reequipping your weapon is necessary to update the character sheet.

* **Superior Weapon Focus:** Adds an extra +1 ab at levels 10, 29, and 30.  This most likely will only show in the combat log and not on the character sheet.

* **Epic Superior Weapon Focus:** Weapon Masters continue to gain +1 every three levels all the way to 50th.  At 50th level weapon master will receive a total of +17 AB with their weapons of choice.

* **(Improved) Whirlwind Attack:** When a Weapon Master does a Whirlwind Attack all targets hit take 1d10 per Weapon Master level of their base weapon damage.  Improved: two attacks will be done.
