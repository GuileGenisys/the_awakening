============================

#### Rationale

Itemization in NWN isn't so great and also doesn't lend itself that well to randomization.  Some of these wouldn't make a ton of sense given the choices made previously, but perhaps they could be worked in.

#### Description

* +/- X% Experience Point Gain.
* Damage Bonus Ranges: I.e. Damage Bonus 4-10 Fire.
* +/- X% Spell Damage.
* +/- X% Damage Bonus.
* +/- X% Crit Damage Bonus. (See AIP #4)
* +/- X% Crit Chance. (See AIP #4)
* Stacking Damage Resistance/Soak.
* +/- Spell DC.
* +/- x% Movement Speed.
* +/- x% Immunity.  E,g. +10% Immunity to Knockdown.
* x% On hit effect/cast spell.  E,g. 5% chance to cast Destruction on hit.  Currently the OnHit stuff firing every hit is unusable.
* +/- Gold Gain.

**Notes**:
* All most all of these would be applied via effects, so they would be available for buffs as well.
