Notes
---------------
  * Probably best to make sure this isn't so much better than the LBS that everyone has to get this one instead.
  * General idea/theory for this feat is a kind of a rage, so I believe that AB and AC are out due to more careless movements.  Damage would seem appropriate, but I left it out in favor of regeneration and damage immunity.
  * These would not stack with LBS.
