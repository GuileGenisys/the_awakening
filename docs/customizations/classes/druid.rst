**Future Directions:**

* With many new additions itâ€™s not clear exactly how the individual shapes would need to be changed, so they have not changed.
* Spells will continue to be revised until there seems to be a reasonable balance.

Polymorphing
------------

* All gear merges and properly stacks in every shape. Occasionally in the unarmed shapes the character sheet won't properly reflect your gear and so you'll need to check the combat log to ensure that your gear is properly merged.
* On The Awakening characters are saved when they rest and when they acquire or unacquire an item, so you will be 'deshifted' momentarily before your polymorph is re-applied in the latter cases.
* See the Polymorph for specifics on what bonuses are applied when shifted.
