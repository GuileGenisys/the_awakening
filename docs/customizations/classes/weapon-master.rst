**Feat Customizations**

Weapon of Choice (unarmed)
  This feat is available with the custom hak and thus unarmed WM monks are possible.

Ki Damage
  This feat has been changed such that it is now a passive feat.  It grants +1 damage bonus per 3 wm levels to a maximum of +16.  Reequipping your weapon is necessary to update the character sheet.

Superior Weapon Focus
  Adds an extra +1 ab at levels 10, 29, and 30.  This most likely will only show in the combat log and not on the character sheet.

Epic Superior Weapon Focus
  Weapon Masters continue to gain +1 every three levels all the way to 50th.  At 50th level weapon master will receive a total of +17 AB with their weapons of choice.

(Improved) Whirlwind Attack
  When a Weapon Master does a Whirlwind Attack all targets hit take 1d10 per Weapon Master level of their base weapon damage.  Improved: two attacks will be done.
