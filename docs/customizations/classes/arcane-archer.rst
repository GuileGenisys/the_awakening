Feat Customizations
-------------------

Death Arrow
  AA does a ranged touch attack. Targets that are hit will take half their current hitpoints in piercing damage, with a fortitude save for half.  If the touch attack is a critical hit, the effect becomes exactly like Harm, except the damage is piercing.  DC is calculated as 10 + Wisdom or Dexterity Modifier (whichever is higher) + 1 per 5 Arcane Archer levels.

Hail of Arrows
  Hail does 1d8 of piercing damage per AA level to a maximum of 50d8 and also 1d8 of magical damage per Enchant Arrow feat.  Hail requires enemies to be in line of sight.  I.e. no shooting through walls.

Imbue Arrow
  Damage to the targeted creature remains the same.  The area explosion damage has been increased to 1d10 of fire per AA level +1 per AA levels to a maximum of 50d10 + 50.

Seeker Arrow
  Seeker Arrow does 1d12 of piercing damage per AA level to a maximum of 50d12 plus 1d12 of magical damage per Enchant Arrow feat.
