  These feats each will add +1 to your base attack bonus, maximum +5.  This may not show on the character sheet, check the combat log to be sure.  This **does not** count towards the +20 ab cap.

Wholeness of Body
  TODO

Monk Speed
  Monk speed no longer scales with Monk level, but rather provides a flat 20% movement speed increase.  This does not stack with *Barbarian Fast Movement*, however, it does stack with other movement speed bonuses from gear and effects.
