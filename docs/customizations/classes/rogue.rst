Crippling Strike
  At 30 levels of Rogue crit range is increased by 1. At 35 levels of rogue also gains +1 to their critical hit multiplier.  To use this the rogue must be using a simple weapon.

  **Multiplier does not stack with Devastating Critical.**

  **Range does not stack with Overwhelming Critical or WM**

Opportunist
  At 25 levels of Rogue, they add their intelligence modifier to their attack roll. For every five levels above 20 (with a cap at 40) Rogues are able to use +1 from their Int modifier At 30 levels, they gain an additional point. Thus the max for a pure rogue would be +5. This does not count against the +20 ab cap.

  * 25th Level: +1
  * 30th Level: +3
  * 35th Level: +4
  * 40th Level: +5

Self Concealment
  At 30 levels of rogue, characters may add a percentage of their Hide skill to their self concealment. The bonus is 5% for SC1 and proceeds to 9%, 12%, 14%, and 15%. The bonus is capped at 1% of Hide skill per level of rogue above 20 (so, the cap begins at 10% at 30 levels of rogue and reaches its maximum of 15% at 35 levels of rogue).
