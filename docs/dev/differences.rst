Differences to v1
=================

It's important to realize that while some of these things have been removed a large part of the impetus was the rather poor implementations.  So maybe some of these can be worked back in.

* No subraces or subclasses
* No mithril weapons
* No epic bonus spell slots.
* No full immunity to effects, e.g. Death, critical hits, etc.
* A number of skills, spells, and feats have been culled.
* No parry, craft armor, craft weapon.
* None of the Strength/Dexterity critical immunity stuff.
