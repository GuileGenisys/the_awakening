AIP2 - Purple Knight Dragon Revamp
==================================

:author: tonoplast

:status: Draft

Rationale
---------

Some of current PDK abilities are not working properly, and some are not very useful on the mod. Duration of the abilities is the major concern, as it only lasts a minute or two for level 40 PDK, and it requires change.

Stated Goals
------------

Change would allow players to explore more into PDK builds, as there is hardly any PDKs around.

* **Level 1**: Fear
* **Level 3**: Final Stand
* **Level 5**: Heroic Shield, Sacred Right [*]_
* **Level 7**: Inspire Courage*
* **Level 10**: Oath of Wrath
* **Level 13**: Valiance
* **Level 15**: Pious Demand
* **Level 17**: Bonus Feat
* **Level 20**: Vengeance
* **Level 25**: Rallying Cry
* **Level 40**: Virtue

.. [*] Maybe these can be just 1 button thing.
