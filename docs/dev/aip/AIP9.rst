===============================

Basically phase out, but not remove, Weapon Focus, etc, etc weapon specific feats in favor of wield based feats.

Rational
-----------

Given that the overriding philosophy that weapon choice should be largely an aesthetic matter here, this isn't a major or even necessary change.  Everyone has access to all weapon types already.

However... it simplifies things going forward for all players new and old.  It also could open up further opportunities.

Description
-----------

Add (in addition to current weapon feats) (Epic) Weapon Focus, Devistanting Critical, Overwhelming Critical, Improved Critical, Weapon of Choice, (Epic, Superior Epic, Legendary) Weapon Specialization in the following wield classes:

* Unarmed (already done.)
* One-handed.
* Two-handed.
* Ranged.
* Dual Wielding

When weilding weapons in the chosen wield type, it would be exactly as if you had the corresponding weapon feats, regardless of weapon type.
