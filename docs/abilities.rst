Abilities
=========

**Strength:** For every point of base strength your character receives 2% chance of deflecting a critical hit. At 50 strength you become immune to critical hits. This works differently than parry, which is explained below. This modifies whether you take a critical hit. So if you don't have really high strength you probably will want parry too.

**Dexterity:** For every point of base dexterity your character receives 1% chance of dodging a critical hit. This ability stacks with the strength critical hit dodge. But the dexterity dodge effect only starts at after you have a dexterity of 30 points, so at a natural dexterity of 29 a character gets nothing from dexterity but at 30 points one receives 30%. This works differently than parry, which is explained below. This modifies whether you take a critical hit. It does stack with strength.
